## 1. Overview

A boilerplate template to set up [Jekyll 4][jekyll] on a free 
[Heroku][heroku-main] server. Included are additional Jekyll plugins to 
showcase the full capabilities and it comes with an elegantly designed and 
crafted [Material Design Lite][mdl] theme. 

> _If you are looking for version 3 of Jekyll instead of version 4, view 
> [this release][1.3.0] which contains the boilerplate for Jekyll version 3._

Here's what you get in this package.

### 1.1. Features

- Latest Jekyll site running version `4.2.0`.
- All the required Ruby files to run a Jekyll website on Heroku in minutes.
- [jekyll-materialdocs][jekyll-materialdocs] - a beautiful 
  [Material Design Lite][mdl] theme elegantly crafted, installed and 
  configured.
- `static.json` - used by the Heroku static buildpack.
- `Rakefile` - the Heroku Ruby buildpack runs `rake assets:precompile`
  when itâ€™s available.
- `config.ru` - the config file which enables this gem to serve your app on
  Heroku using [RackJekyll][rack].
- `humans.md` file which outputs a human-readable file to [/humans.txt][humans]
- Various plugins which enhance the functionality of Jekyll _(see below for 
  all the details)_.

### 1.2. Plugins

## 2. Getting Started

These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. [See deployment][deploy]
for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### 2.1. Prerequisites

The following prerequisites need to be installed on your machine for this to
work.

1. [Heroku Toolbelt][toolbelt] - the CLI interface to Heroku.
1. A package manager for your Operating System:
    - macOS: [Homebrew][brew]
    - Windows: [Chocolatey][choc]
    - Linux: `apt-get` or `yum` (distro dependent)
1. [Ruby][ruby]
1. [Bundler][bundler] - to manage Ruby gems (see below).

Once you have installed `ruby`, installing `bundler` is pretty straightforward.
Simply run this command in a terminal window.

```console
$ gem install bundler
```

## 3. Installing

### 3.1. Clone the Repository

The first step is to clone this repository to a location on your computer. For
this example, we will assume that your default install location is a folder
called `jekyll-heroku-starter-kit`.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/justinhartman/jekyll-heroku-starter-kit
```

The above command will checkout the source code to the folder
`jekyll-heroku-starter-kit/`. You can change the default location by specifying
a folder name in the checkout command with:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/justinhartman/jekyll-heroku-starter-kit custom-folder
```

### 3.2. Creating the Heroku App

Running the `heroku apps:create` command will create a new app on Heroku and
add a reference to a git repository on Heroku itself.

```console
$ cd jekyll-heroku-starter-kit/
$ heroku apps:create jekyll-heroku-starter-kit
Creating â¬¢ jekyll-heroku-starter-kit... done
https://jekyll-heroku-starter-kit.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/jekyll-heroku-starter-kit.git
```

You can check that the new Heroku repo has been added to your `git` repo with
the following command.

```console
$ git config --list
remote.heroku.url=https://git.heroku.com/jekyll-heroku-starter-kit.git
remote.heroku.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/heroku/*
remote.origin.url=https://github.com/justinhartman/jekyll-heroku-starter-kit.git
remote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
```

### 3.3. Install the required Gems

The `Gemfile` in this repository contains everything needed to setup Jekyll and
get your app ready for publishing to Heroku. Run the following command to
install all the required dependencies.

```console
$ bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
$ bundle install
```

### 3.4. Adding Heroku Buildpacks

We need to install a few buildpacks to tell Heroku how to handle the app. You
need to install the following by executing these commands:

```console
$ heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby
$ heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-static
```

### 3.5. Running Jekyll Locally

Once done with the above you should test your Jekyll installation to ensure
that you can run the site on your machine. This is very important before 
deploying your app to Heroku.

Run the `jekyll serve` command to test your app.

```console
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
Configuration file: /jekyll-heroku-starter-kit/_config.yml
Invalid theme folder: _includes
            Source: /jekyll-heroku-starter-kit
       Destination: /jekyll-heroku-starter-kit/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
      Generating...
         AutoPages: Disabled/Not configured in site.config.
        Pagination: Disabled in site.config.
                    done in 1.238 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/jekyll-heroku-starter-kit'
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

By visiting [http://127.0.0.1:4000][localhost] you should see your newly
built Jekyll site. This is an example of what you should be seeing.

## 4. Deployment

With everything completed in the steps above you can now deploy to Heroku. 
Execute the following commands to deploy a build to heroku.

```console
$ cd jekyll-heroku-starter-kit/
$ git push heroku master
```

This will generate a build log that should resemble the below success.

```console
Enumerating objects: 7, done.
Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.
